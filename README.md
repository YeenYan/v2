# Personal Website V2 ðŸ”¥

Hey there! Thanks for dropping by to check out my latest portfolio website repository. This website isn't just your typical portfolioâ€”it's a personal project that I'm super excited about. Over the past year, I've been honing my skills as a developer and designer, and this website is a way for me to show off what I've learned and accomplished. So, take a look around and see what I've been up to!

## What I used

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) my coding soulmate
- [Github](https://github.com/) for easy collaborative coding
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- [Talwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility-first CSS framework for less time-consuming
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) open source for font and icons

Let me know what you think!
